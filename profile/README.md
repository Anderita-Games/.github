As a kid, I have always been interested in technology and programming. This passion led me to start creating apps using the Unity engine. Throughout my high school education, I made a total of 100 apps, which have all been published on the Google Play Store and a few on the iOS app store. All of the code for these apps can be found in this organization.

It all started when I made my first app as a freshman in 2015. I was so excited to show it to my dad, but he jokingly commented that it would be crazy to make 100 of them. However, I took this challenge seriously and set a goal to create 100 apps before graduating high school.

Through this process, I have learned a lot about the Unity engine, rapid prototyping, user interface, and user experience design. I have also gained an understanding of game theory and how to apply it to app development.

Making 100 apps has been a rewarding and challenging experience. It has allowed me to improve my skills and expand my knowledge of technology and programming. I am proud of my work and am excited to see what the future holds for my app development journey.
